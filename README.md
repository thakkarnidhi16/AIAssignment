# CSI 4106 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## Assignment 1: Data Preparation

The Kaggle datasets require a login for download, which adds unnecessary complexity to the assignment. To streamline the process, I have uploaded the data to GitHub.

In your notebook, you can access and read the data directly from this GitHub repository.
